      "Murphy Ben International (MBI) began with a singular vision: to solve the fragmentation of the African entertainment market. Founded by Murphy Ben, the company identified early on that while African content—specifically Nollywood—was in high demand, the distribution channels were broken.",
      "In 2013, we launched Aforevo, initially as a YouTube-first strategy to capture the diaspora audience. By leveraging data analytics and direct licensing, we grew Aforevo into one of the continent's largest Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs).",
      "Today, MBI has evolved into a 360-degree digital powerhouse. From our dubbing studios in Lagos translating content into French, Swahili, and Lingala, to our tech division building anti-piracy tools, we are no longer just distributing content; we are defining the ecosystem."
